## ADS-B GHOST
This project consists in the implementation of a ghost aircraft, simulating a real one. This aircraft use an ADS-B (Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast).

### ADS-B encoder features
1. The ADS-B encoder is a WIP (work in progress) package to encode ADS-B frames.
2. This package encode aircraft ID messages and WIP aircraft position.

### ADS-B decoder features
1. The features of this package can be seen at https://github.com/junzis/pyModeS

### ADS-B ghost features
1.  
2.

### CRC calculator features
1. CRC (Cyclic redundancy check) file is used to calculate CRC to frames.

### Ghost aircraft features
1.
2. 

###Util package features
1. This package implements some common functions like hex2bin, bin2int, hex2int, crc, gray2int.
